# neural-network-challenge-1  
Module_18_Challenge

__Purpose__: In this Challenge we display knowledge of neural network models in a real world example of a studen loan recommendation system.
  
    
&nbsp; &nbsp; __Step 1__: Preparing the data for use on a neural network model  
&nbsp; &nbsp; __Step 2__: Compile and Evaluate a Model Using a Neural Network    
&nbsp; &nbsp;__Step 3__: Predict loan repayment success by using your neural network model  
&nbsp; &nbsp;__Step 4__: Discuss creating a recommendation system for student loans

__Intalls__: A number of installations are needed (and provided) to run the code necessary to complete this project
